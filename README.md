# Sudoku Solver

## Introduction
This is a simple sudoku solver which uses the [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) to solve the sudoku.
The backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, where all the candidates solutions to the problem are tried and, if they aren't valid (they can't be used to complete the problem), abandoned.
